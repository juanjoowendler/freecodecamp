              Alan Mathison Turing was born on June 23, 1912 in Maida Vale,
              London.

            <p>
              At the age of 13, Alan Turing first showed signs of intelligence
              and potential which was noticed at the Sherborne School.

            <p>
              Alan Turing studied from 1931 to 1934 at King's College, in
              Cambridge. He was first in his class and was an honor student in
              the field of mathematics.

            <p>
              Turing studied mathematics and cryptology while also building
              three of four stages of an electro-mechanical binary multiplier at
              Princeton University.

            <p>
              Turing helped to solve the essential part of the German naval
              indicator system and also came up with the idea of sequential
              analysis.

            <p>
              Turing was responsible for creating the Bombe which was a
              cryptanalytic machine used to decrypt the Enigma-enciphered
              messages being sent from the enemies.

            <p>
              Turing traveled to the United States to work with the US naval
              cryptanalysts to create their version of the Bombe and an Enigma
              in Washington.

              He presented his paper in February of 1946 where he had presented
              the first detailed design of a stored program computer setup.

              Turing lived in Hampton, London where worked on the design of the
              ACE (Automatic Computing Engine).

            <p>
              Turing created the LU decomposition method that was used and is
              still used today to solve matrix equations.

            <p>
              Turing was appointed a position in the mathematics department at
              the University of Manchester where he worked on software for one
              of the earliest stored-program computers.

            <span class="li-title">Turing Test</span>
            <p>
              The turing test was created in 1950. The turing test was created
              to compare the intelligence of a machine/computer to the
              intelligence of a human brain.

            <span class="li-title">Indecency</span>
            <p>
              Turing was caught in a relationship with an unemployed 19 year old
              man. He was convicted for indecency because homosexual acts were
              considered criminal offences in the United Kingdom at the time.
              This is what lead to his downhill spiral right before his suicide.

            <p>
              Turing's book "The Chemical Basis of Morphogenesis" was published
              in 1952 which was all about his interest in the biology of
              organisms.

              Turing committed suicide in his house where his housekeeper found
              him dead.
